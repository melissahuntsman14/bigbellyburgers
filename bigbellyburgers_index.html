            <p>Big Belly Burger was created by writer John Byrne in the comic book Adventures of Superman in June 1988.
              The fast food chain was given its initial visual appearance by penciller Jerry Ordway.
              The restaurant was inspired by Bob's Big Boy, a real-world chain of restaurants.
            </p><p>
            In DC Comics publications, Big Belly Burger is said to be one of the largest fast-food chains in the United States.
            Founded in Coast City[citation needed] in the 1950s, various stories establish that the chain is now nationwide.
            Big Belly Burger is well-known in the DC Comics universe for its French fries, milkshakes, and large hamburgers.
            Its signature menu items include three burgers: the Belly Buster, the Belly Bloater, and
            the Cheesemeister Deluxe. The Big Belly Burger mascot is a smiling, bearded, red-haired man with glasses
            (modeled on comic book writer and editor Andy Helfer). The mascot is often depicted holding aloft a plate on
            which a large hamburger rests. Variations of the mascot also appear, such as a mascot with an upraised arm
            and no plate. Beginning about 2008, a Big Belly Burger logo began to be depicted in DC Comics. This logo
            consists of a large red circle with a heavy black border, a smaller white smiley off-center at the top of the
            red circle, and two three-fingered cartoonish hands (one in the red circle, one opposite the smiley at the top
            of the red circle). The image looks like a rotund, smiling person patting a fat stomach and giving a thumb's up.
            Big Belly Burger also has a catchphrase, "It's Belly Belly good" (a play on the words "very very good").
            Some Big Belly Burger locations are depicted in the comics as having a "playplace", an area where small children
             can play on jungle gym equipment and slides.
